# RPGCombatSystem

## Objective

**RPGCombatSystem** is a fully functional RPG framework built in **Godot**, designed to be reused across multiple RPG projects.

The project was born out of curiosity — to explore how challenging it would be to recreate a full RPG system similar to the one found in **RPG Maker** engines, but with full control and flexibility.

This framework provides a solid foundation for building turn-based RPGs with reusable systems and clean code structure.
